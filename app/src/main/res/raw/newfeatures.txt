* Added zoom in, zoom out, and reset zoom buttons to the radar/satellite
* Double tap on radar/satellite zooms in
* Tap and drag to move the radar/satellite view
* Updated location API. Hopefully, this fixes some (or all) of the location issues
* Added some additional error handling for when API tells me that marine forecasts not yet supported
* Some additional minor bug fixes
