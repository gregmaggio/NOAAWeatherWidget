* Made the widgets a little bigger
* Use the default font size for the widgets
* Some refactoring to move the current weather stats out of the main application activity to be shared acrossed any widget
* When using the widgets, a service will run in the background. This service will get new observation stats every thirty minutes to update the widgets
* Start/Stop Service still exists in the dot menu on the right
* You can stop the service at anytime if you don't want it running. Just the widgets won't update automatically.
